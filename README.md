# GameX
A Spigot minigame core, built from the ground up.

# The goal
The goal with this is to easily be able to create minigames, built with one big core, instead of having unnecessary code in all my minigames.

# Will it be available to anyone?
Sooner or later. It won't be at first, but when I'm done with the main work, feel free to use it, and make it better.
